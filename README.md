# the-peoples-rideshare
An app that aims to connect folks who need rides to folks who can give rides. 

## About

There are a lot of us trans folks in Kansas City who need rides to places. There are folks who are willing to give folks rides to the places they need to go. I thought it would be cool to develop an app to connect those people. 

This will also serve as a teaching project for those who want to learn how to code. I'm under no illusion that learning to code will fix any problem other than "I don't know how to code and I'd like to learn", but it's a useful skill to have. 

Finally, this app will be free, both as in beer and in freedom. If someone wants to spot someone else some money for giving them a ride, that's cool, but no money will change hands via the app.
